            Moodle is the ultimate app for food enthusiasts who want to keep
            track of their experiencesâ€”whether at favorite spots or newly
            discovered locations. Easily review restaurants and bars you've
            visited, document your amazing (and not-so-amazing) meals and
            drinks, and use your personal journal to track your reviews and save
            places you want to visit. Additionally it also comes with a map to
            give you a clear overview of all your documented spots!
